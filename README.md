## Introduction
>No one reads anything on the internet. <sup>[Link.]

Not even this readme.  A good introduction is clear, short, and to the point.

To convince someone to stay,  I suggest splitting this introduction into  **two short paragraphs**:
1.  **State Your Purpose**
	Describe the importance of your project and what it does
	
2. **Make it Skim-able** 
 Describe any key concepts (technical, philosophical, or both) important to the userâ€™s understanding

Limit yourself to about 5 lines per paragraph.

### Contributors

There are countless programs that can edit markdown formatted files:

-   **[markdownify](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/electron-markdownify)  [Windows, free]**  
    My personal favorite. The code is highlighted and converted into a live preview. The UI is intuitive and minimalistic. Local links are supported and even images from the internet (such as badges) are shown in the preview.
    
-   **[markdown editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/)  [Web, free]**  
    Not as good as markdownify, but available without installing anything. Its formatting closely resembles how it will look on GitHub.
